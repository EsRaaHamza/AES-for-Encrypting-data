# AES-for-Encrypting-data
AES encryption expects from user to enter four values
the first input is how many plain texts user wants to encrypt  .. 
the second input is the plain text itself "128 bits "16 byte" represented as Hexadecimal numbers .. "
the third input is the key "128 bits "16 bytes" represented as Hexadecimal numbers .. "
the forth input is how many times user wants the plaintext to pass through the 10 rounds

the output will be the result
